This model checks the counters of a bounded queue with ordered output.
`next` counts claimed items, `consumed` counts consumed items, and at most
`w` items may be in flight. To adapt it:

1. Transcribe the state and steps from the code with the same arithmetic.
2. State the invariant as a `Prop` with a `Decidable` instance.
3. Run `#eval badPairs` to find states where a step violates the invariant
   within the chosen bound, and keep the `#guard` that fails the build on one.
4. Prove the invariant for every size by cases on the step.

Name any unfinished proof that uses `sorry`. `lean-check.sh` fails on it, on
any declaration that rests on a declared axiom, and on a `.lean` file that no
library in the lakefile owns.

Each model is one file under `Model/` in a namespace named after it, so the
models of a repository share one Lake project and their names do not clash.
`BoundedQueue.mutations` lists the bugs this model must detect.
