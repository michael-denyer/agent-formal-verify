   The counters of a bounded queue with ordered output: `next` counts claimed
   items, `consumed` counts consumed items, and at most `Window` items may be
   in flight. It is the same model as ../lean-template/Model/BoundedQueue.lean.
   TLC checks it for the instances in BoundedQueue.matrix; Lean proves it for
   every size. BoundedQueue.mutations lists the bugs its properties must detect.

   To adapt it, replace the header with the source files and line ranges the
   model follows, give each thread a program counter, and keep the top-level
   formula named Spec, which tlc-matrix.sh checks. *)

Consume == /\ consumed < next
